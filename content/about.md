[Hej](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hej),
I am a researcher in the field of geoinformatics and my main focus lies on the development of spatio-semantic road space models for testing automated driving functions.
Thematically, this is a combination of the disciplines semantic city models, HD maps, submicroscopic driving simulation and sensor modeling.
I work within the research project [SAVe](https://save-in.digital) and am supervised by [Thomas H. Kolbe](https://www.lrg.tum.de/en/gis/our-team/staff/prof-thomas-h-kolbe/) at the [Chair of Geoinformatics](https://www.lrg.tum.de/en/gis) of the Technical University of Munich.

Besides, I am interested in coding (at the moment mainly Kotlin, C++, Python and Java), software architecture and digital disruptions.
During my free time I like to ride my racing and mountain bikes â€“ preferably Italian ones.
Otherwise, I look for the perfect lighting.
